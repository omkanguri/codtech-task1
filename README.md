Overview of the project
Project: LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
Objective:
	Understand Basic Electronics: Learn the fundamental concepts of electronic components, including LEDs and resistors, and how they function in a circuit.
	Familiarize with Arduino: Gain hands-on experience with the Arduino platform, including setting up the hardware, writing code, and uploading it to the microcontroller.
	Learn Programming Basics: Understand the basics of programming in the Arduino IDE, including functions, variables, and control structures (like loops and delays).
	Implement Control Logic: Develop skills in controlling output devices (like LEDs) based on programmed logic, which is foundational for more complex projects.
	Experiment with Timing: Explore how to manipulate timing and delays in a program, which can lead to understanding more advanced concepts like timers and interrupts.
